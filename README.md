Weather prediction using statistical deep learning 
Weather forecasting is the prediction of the state of the atmosphere for a given location using the application of science and technology.
This includes temperature, rain, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.
We will use statistics and probability in weather prediction by using 5 topics from probability and statistics, will be:-
1. Central limit theorem
2. Estimating variance
3. Discrete probably distribution
4. Discrete cumulative distribution
5. Bayes theorem
6. Na√Øve Bayes theorem
